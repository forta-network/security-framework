# Threat Modeling & Security Design

![](threat-modeling-security-design.png)

- **What**: Implement an explicit practice of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system from the very beginning of the SDLC. Developers should identify any security controls that will be necessary to implement in development and any threats that should be checked for in testing, audits, and monitoring.
- **Why**: It can be tempting for developers to focus solely on the intended uses of a smart contract or protocol, but this can leave them with blind spots that attackers can exploit.
- **How**: Follow known [threat modeling practices](https://github.com/securing/SCSVS/blob/master/1.2/0x10-V1-Architecture-Design-Threat-modelling.md). If a development team does not have in-house security expertise, it should engage with security consultants early in the design phase.
