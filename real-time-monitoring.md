# Real-Time Monitoring

![](real-time-monitoring.png)

- **What**: Implement systems that monitor smart contracts and critical operational components such as oracles and bridges, and report suspicious activity to the development team and community based on known threat models.
- **Why**: Early detection of issues allows a team to respond to exploits and bugs quickly, potentially stopping or mitigating any damage.
- **How**: Use monitoring platforms such as [Defender Sentinels](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/sentinel) and [Forta](https://forta.org/)â€™s network of distributed nodes to run bots that monitor smart contract events in near real-time. Forta can also be configured to provide dashboards and alert notifications for development teams and the wider community.
