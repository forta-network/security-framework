# Incentivizing Community Engagement

![](incentivizing-community-engagement.png)

- **What**: Create programs that encourage community participation in security improvement on open-source codebases. One way to do this is by creating bug bounties. Another way is to encourage the community to develop protocol-monitoring detection bots.
- **Why**: Development teams often benefit greatly from tapping into a wider pool of knowledge and experience. Moreover, such programs can help generate enthusiasm for a project, as well as help turn would-be attackers into security assets.
- **How**: Use platforms such as [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) to fund bug bounty systems with severity-based rewards to incentivize highly skilled hackers to safely disclose vulnerabilities. In addition, the [Forta Network](https://forta.org/) — through the use of its [FORT token](https://forta.org/blog/unveiling-fort-token/) — offers a world-first incentive structure for the decentralized creation of high-quality security-monitoring bots. Development teams can encourage their protocols’ communities to take advantage of both of these opportunities to profit by enhancing security.
